This repository reflects my [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/moonscape09/) progress broken down into different problem lists provided by LeetCode itself.

There is a <code>README.md</code> documentation file providing justification of each solution I write in Python3 (i.e data structures used, solution walkthrough, complexity etc.) to portray my understanding and documenting style while interacting with Git and GitHub.
